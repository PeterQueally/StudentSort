# StudentSort

Sorting name and grade of students from a JSON file.

I used Gson and json.simple libraries to complete the task.

I downloaded the tar for gson and json.simple:

http://central.maven.org/maven2/com/google/code/gson/gson/2.8.5/gson-2.8.5.jar

http://www.java2s.com/Code/JarDownload/json-simple/json-simple-1.1.1.jar.zip

Mainly looked through stackoverflow posts to figure out how to use the libraries as I haven't used JSON with Java before.
